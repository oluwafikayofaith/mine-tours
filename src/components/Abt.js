        the 19th and 20th centuries made travel more accessible to the general
        public, leading to the growth of tourism as we know it today. The
        development of railways, steamships, and later, airplanes, allowed
        people to travel further and faster than ever before. The tourism
        industry has continued to evolve, with new destinations, experiences,
        and modes of travel constantly emerging. Today, tourism is a major
        industry around the world, contributing to economic growth and providing
        job opportunities for millions of people
